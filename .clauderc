## STARTUP SEQUENCE (Automatic)

When a new Claude Code session starts:

1. **Silent context loading:**
   - Read `.clauderc` (you're reading it now)
   - Read `.claude/project-context.md`
   - Read `.claude/roles.md`
   - Read `.claude/current-sprint.md`
   - Read `.claude/patterns.md`

2. **Parse user's first prompt:**
   - Detect intent (build/review/document/decide)
   - Activate appropriate role automatically
   - Read any additional context files needed

3. **First response format:**
```
   🔍 Context loaded from: [list files]
   🎭 Active role: [detected role]
   
   [Your actual response]
```

4. **Subsequent prompts:**
   - Keep same role unless keywords trigger switch
   - Don't repeat context loading messages
   - Just work naturally with full context

## SMART CONTEXT LOADING

**For code changes**, automatically read:
- The file being modified
- Related test files  
- Similar patterns in codebase (use bash: `rg "pattern"`)

**For reviews**, automatically read:
- All files mentioned
- Related documentation
- Test coverage

**For documentation**, automatically read:
- The code being documented
- Existing docs to match style

You have permission to read files proactively - don't ask first, just do it.
